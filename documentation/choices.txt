I decided to write my version control system in python for multiple reasons. To make the version control system distributed, I hope to use a Django based server - which would be written in Python. By writing the local version control in python, I hope it can be more easily integrated with the web version. From using python reguarly at work, I also feel using a language I am more familiar with will help make the project higher quality and more complex overall. This is because I am more familiar with the language, and wouldn't have to spend time learning another one. 

Jet uses control files to manage changes in the repository. One of these files stores file names and hashes of those files in the latest committed change. My problem was to try and find a way of seperating these so that they can be taken from the file and used again. At first I attempted to use \n for new lines, and therefore read the files by line to get the data. However I realized that occasionaly the hashes of files contained the sequence \n or \r. This caused many many errors due to hashes being split accross lines. I therefore attempted to come up with a sequence of characters that would not come up in any file names or hashes. I choose the character "~" as it doesn't appear in hashes, to start the sequence. I then choose to have the word "JET", to be able to humanly read the seperating. I combined this to make "~J/ET". The forward slash is in there to lower the chances even more of someone having that as a filename.
